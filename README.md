# Hey there, I’m Qumber Rizvi 👋

I'm a Senior Full Stack Engineer with 6+ years of experience building scalable backend systems and user-centric frontend applications. I specialize in TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js. I enjoy working across the stack, diving into system design, DevOps, and building products that are secure, fast, and elegant.

Currently, I’m:
- 💼 Working at [Liminal](https://liminalcustody.com), where we’re building secure digital asset custody infrastructure.
- 🛠 Exploring Dart and Flutter to expand into cross-platform app development.
- 🧠 Passionate about open-source and looking to collaborate on projects built with TypeScript, JavaScript, or Flutter.
